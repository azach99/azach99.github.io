			<h5>July 2020</h5>
			<p class="sample-text">
				The Hive is a Social Media Web Application designed to allow members of a Student Organization on a College Campus University to get to know each other. Furthermore, The Hive allows Admins of such Student Organization to pair members in Mentor/Mentee, Big/Little, Brother/Sister etc. Programs. Various features for users consist of the ability to fill and view their application, create a profile, and search other members of the Student Organization based on Big/Little or gender. Various features for Admins consist of the ability to pair members together, view both the application and profile of each user, and search based on a few criteria. This Web Application was written with open source CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. The Python and HTML of this Web Application were written by myself.

			<h5>June 2020</h5>
			<p class="sample-text">
				The FASA Officer Application Portal was designed to reduce the work executed on a taxing task for Executive Board Members of FASA. To begin, if a member wanted to apply to become an officer for FASA, the applicant would need to download a Word Document onto their computer and submit it by emailing the Executive Board. To view an application, the Executive Board would need to download the application on their computer and view the application from their. This Web Application reduces all of the unnecessary work.
			</p>
			<p class="sample-text">
				This Web Application is designed to reduce the amount of storage on a user's computer whether they be an applicant or an Executive Board Member and stores such memory onto an external web server. Not only does this web application save memory on a computer, but it gives Executive Board Members flexible features designed to make this process that much easier. Such functionality consists of filtering applicants based on a specified committee, writing personal notes for each applicant, and searching applicants based on a few criteria.

			<h3 class="text-heading title_color">JP Speaks</h3>
			<h5>June 2020</h5>
			<p class="sample-text">
				JP Speaks is a Web Application designed to promote the purposes of an Instagram Account that I came across. This Instagram Account encourages students to speak out in times of Racial and Homophobic oppression that occurred throughout their time to the High School that I graduated from during the month of June 2020. This allows students to voice their opinions and experiences in an Anonymous setting. 
			</p>
			<p class="sample-text">
				The Web Application works as follows: users what submit their Point of View on the Website as well as their graduating year. The Admins of the Website can then view an applicant's submission. Upon consideration by the Admin, the Admin can then determine if a submission is allowed to be posted on this Instagram Account. SQLAlchemy was used to log, record, and view all submissions by various users.
